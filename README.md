**Opening Speech**

Distinguished guests, colleagues, and dear participants,

Good morning and a warm welcome to all of you to this important Horizon Europe Info & Training Session for Individual Researchers. On behalf of the Deputy Dean of Research and Innovation, Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, it is my great pleasure to welcome Mr. A and Mr. B from EURAXESS ASEAN, the organizers of this event, as well as all our esteemed researchers and aspiring doctoral candidates who are here with us today.

We are gathered here today to discuss and explore the exciting opportunities presented by Horizon Europe, the European Union’s flagship research and innovation programme. This programme is a key driver for scientific and technological collaboration across borders, uniting researchers and institutions from all over the world to address the most pressing global challenges of our time. It is an honor for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia to host this event, as it reflects our strong commitment to fostering research excellence and building international collaborations that are instrumental to solving complex, real-world problems.

In particular, today's session will focus on the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA), which include both the Doctoral Networks and the Postdoctoral Fellowship opportunities. The MSCA programmes are among the most prestigious research initiatives under Horizon Europe, designed specifically to cultivate talent and support the career development of researchers at all stages of their journey. For our young researchers and future leaders, these opportunities are invaluable—not only do they offer the possibility to carry out research at leading institutions across Europe, but they also emphasize skill development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and international mobility.

We are very fortunate to have Mr. A and Mr. B here from EURAXESS ASEAN to lead this training session. EURAXESS has been instrumental in connecting researchers in Southeast Asia with opportunities across Europe, and their experience and insights will be incredibly beneficial for those of you who are interested in pursuing these prestigious fellowships. I encourage you to make the most of this opportunity—ask questions, share your thoughts, and learn as much as you can about how to successfully navigate the application process and make your research dreams a reality.

At Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, we have always placed great emphasis on providing our researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in an increasingly competitive global landscape. We recognize that the challenges of today—from climate change and sustainability to technological advancement and public health—require collaborative and innovative approaches that extend beyond national boundaries. This is precisely why Horizon Europe and the MSCA programmes are so important; they foster a culture of shared knowledge, mobility, and interdisciplinary research that aligns perfectly with our mission to produce impactful research with real-world implications.

To all our participants today, I want to remind you that opportunities like this one are the stepping stones to becoming leaders in your respective fields. The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions are not only about funding; they are about being part of a community that values scientific inquiry, international collaboration, and lifelong learning. Whether you are looking to advance your career as a postdoctoral fellow or are an aspiring doctoral candidate eager to start your journey, today’s session will provide you with essential insights into how to make that next step.

Once again, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to EURAXESS ASEAN for their collaboration, and to all of you for taking the time to be here today. I hope this session will be both informative and inspiring, and that it will open new doors for each of you in your academic and professional pursuits. Let us work together to strengthen our research capabilities, build meaningful international connections, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge that benefits society as a whole.

Thank you very much, and I look forward to an engaging and productive session ahead.
